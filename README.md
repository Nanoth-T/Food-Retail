# Food-Retail

**Goal**: Analyzing the "Carbo-loading: A Relational Database" from [dunnhumby](https://www.dunnhumby.com/source-files/) 
to gain insights into the business and enhance overall business performance.

The data consists of four tables:
- Product_Lookup: Provides information about each product corresponding to a unique UPC.
- Causal_Lookup: Provides information about the activity for each UPC for each store.
- Transactions: Contains transaction details covering a two-year period.
- Store_Lookup: Provides each storeâ€™s zip code.

This project has a one-week time limit, and while it may not be at its optimal state, I plan to continue improving it in the future.
The project includes:
- **Python Script**: Developed to extract insights from the data and utilize the information to create solutions aimed at increasing profitability.

- **Presentation**: A comprehensive summary of the work, explained in business terms.
